# WISHING-WELL
Wishing Well is an interactive lighting installation representing a water fountain that is activated by the tossing of a coin in the water after which, in a sort of gratitude, the fountain creates an audiovisual experience. An intimate atmosphere supports lighting interaction while the musical background, sound of water and lighting design influence the overall impression having positive effects especially on children. The installation is also humanitarian in nature as Visualia Festival was regularly involved in such actions during the entire festival. 
The installation is designed as follows: a visitor approaches the fountain and with his/her movement activates a sensor. The sensor then activates a microcontroller giving a signal for playing a music theme and switching on the lights i.e. creating a light show.
